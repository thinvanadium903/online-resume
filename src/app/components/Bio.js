                    Hello! Thank you for visiting my online portfolio. It contains links to my resum√©, 
                    cover letter, LinkedIn profile, academic transcript, my contact information, 
                    and some samples of my work.

                    I am currently a computer science student in my senior year at the University of 
                    Georgia. This site was made in December 2024 as my final portfolio project for my Career and 
                    Life Planning Class. Updates will be made in the future as needed.
                </p>

                    To Professor Dr. Nikki Hawkins, thank you so much for an amazing semester! You 
                    were very helpful and kind throughout the semester and I wish you the best.
